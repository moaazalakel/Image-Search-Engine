# Image Search/Retrieval Application

## Overview
This project is an advanced Image Search/Retrieval Application that allows users to search for images based on their content. It leverages deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to extract and compare image features efficiently.

## Features
- **Feature Extraction**: Uses a pre-trained CNN model to extract meaningful features from images.
- **Efficient Search**: Implements nearest neighbor search algorithms for fast image retrieval.
- **Scalability**: Supports large-scale image datasets.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a web-based UI for uploading and searching images.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn
- Flask (for the web interface)
- SQLite/PostgreSQL (for metadata storage)

## Usage
1. Upload an image via the web interface.
2. The system extracts its features and searches for similar images in the dataset.
3. Results are displayed with similarity scores.

## Dataset
- The application supports custom datasets.
- Images are indexed using feature extraction before performing searches.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement AI-powered text-based search for images.
- Improve search accuracy using advanced deep learning models.
- Optimize for large-scale distributed environments.
